# <Sam's Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a home base for all of the information I will be learning over the next 6 months through this program.

I built this project to keep the information I will be learning about properly organized in a secure environment.

This project solves the issue of losing track of the progress I will make during the next 6 months.

I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
